# AdFusion
Research based on ad-copy and image generation.

By enhancing the contextual understanding of LLMs, AdFusion aim to create a model that better grasps the intent and tone of ad copy, resulting in images that are not just relevant but also creatively aligned with the message.

The source code for this project is currently in Google Colabs and is under development, the rest of the source code on how to put the pretrained model into LaVi-Bridge and the contents of the research paper will be uploaded here by end of November.


## Fine Tuning

This t5_trainer.ipynb file is used to fine tune the model T5.

You can use [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or install [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to fine tune the model.

**Just remember you have to insall Jupyter Notebook and it is strongly suggested you have a GPU (preferrably NVIDIA to use Cuda)**

**If you would like to not worry about Jupyter Notebook, you can use colab which provides you with a GPU called T4 (you just have to switch to it)**

### How to set up Jupyter Notebook

You can either download the Anaconda Navigator and open Jupyter Notebooks from there or directly download Jupyter Notebooks there.

Create a new notebook and set a Python environment that has torch and numpy installed.

Follow the instructions and code in t5_trainer.ipynb to fine tune your model.

### How to set up Google Colab

Sign in with your google account and create a new notebook. 

Since Colab notebook needs to be mounted to drive for it to be saved for later use, you can use this command.

```python 
#Mount the notebook to the drive

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

```

To download the required libraries in colab, it has to be installed like this:

```python 
#Example import statements

!pip install sentencepiece
!pip install transformers
!pip install rich[jupyter]

```

### Setting up the data

If you want to fine tune T5-large or T5-base with your own data, then you can change the base_path and the output_file to your correct directory. 

For example, if you are using Colab and want to access your folders:

```python

# This gets data from this folder structure of parent folder LaVi-Bridge to subfolders 1 to n (the number of folders you have) to each captions.txt and img.jpg files
base_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/LaVi-Bridge"
output_file = "/content/drive/My Drive/LaVi-Bridge/captions.txt"
```

**This model trains from images and text, remember to change the name of the text files from "captions" or "images" to the name of your txt and jpg files.**

Finally if your data is in a csv file, then you can use: 

```python 
#Insert your link here

path = "https://github.com"

df = pd.read_csv(path)

```
